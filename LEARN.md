# <a name="1 Introduction">Introduction:</a>


Children’s literacy and mathematical competencies are not only important prerequisites for academic achievement in school, but are also a critical platform for their successful functioning as individuals later in society. Formal teaching of reading, spelling, and mathematics begins when children enter primary school, however, children acquire abilities that are important for their later learning long before they enter school.
It is preferable to assess these skills early as these precursors are important predictors of academic performance in school. For instance, early vocabulary predicts later literacy competencies and counting skills predict later mathematical competencies.

Given that nowadays, children in many countries worldwide grow up in media-rich homes and are in contact with a wide range of digital tools daily. Digital game-based learning uses the entertaining power of digital games to serve an educational purpose such as teaching math or language. An explosion in available applications (‘apps’) has been noted over the last couple of years, especially for young children, and the majority of top-selling paid apps targeted young
children.

# <a name="2 Methods/Design">Methods/Design:</a>

The original plan in this study was to follow 500 families across four years from 1.5 years before school entry until the end of grade 2. However, the Covid-19 pandemic put an end to the recruitment in March 2020 and led to a later start with the assessments. Consequently, we Niklas et al. decided to apply a two-cohort design instead, in which a second (younger) cohort will be recruited and will start the project at a later time. In the following, we introduce
all information about the first cohort, the kindergarten assessments and the intervention approach that will also apply to the second cohort.

For all research activities in this project, ethics is an integral part from beginning to end. In addition to the approval by the European Research Council Executive Agency, the thorough ethical evaluation also included
ethical evaluation and approvals of the project by: 

1. The ethics committee of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Munich (LMU).
              
2. The department responsible for the implementation and management of research projects in public day care centres in Munich: The Department of Education and Sports, Munich.
              
3. The ministry responsible for the implementation and management of research projects in public schools in Bavaria: The Bavarian Ministry of Education

# <a name="3 Case Study">Case Study:</a>

The first cohort of our sample consists of N = 190 children with their families. Here, N = 60 families were randomly assigned to each of the experimental groups. In addition, N = 35 families were randomly assigned to each
of the control groups with and without tablets. N = 114 participating families were recruited through the kindergartens attended by their child. In Germany, most children are enrolled in kindergartens from 2 to 3 years of
age until the beginning of formal schooling at the age of 6 and almost all children attend kindergartens five days a week for several hours a day in the last two years before school entry

After families signed the consent form, the kindergartens attended by their participating child were contacted and introduced to the project, too. With this approach, N = 71 additional families were recruited.
Five additional families were recruited by word of mouth and leaflets distributed in the city. Altogether, the participating children attended N = 111 different kindergartens. In each participating kindergarten, between N = 1
and N = 11 children (and their parents) participated in our study.

# <a name="4 Measures">Measures:</a>

Assessments in Learning4Kids included educator and
parental surveys and checklists, observations and interviews in the family, and child test assessments:-

a) Educator survey
    
Kindergarten educators were asked to fill in a survey on children’s characteristics. The educators rated the media activities in kindergarten such as which digital tools are available in the kindergarten and how often they are used. Further, the educators were asked to provide a general evaluation about children’s concentration, linguistic, mathematical and socio-emotional competencies. Here, a focus lay on children’s emotional and social
abilities, on children’s behavioural strengths and difficulties and symptoms of attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder.

b) Parental survey

As with the Plain Language Statements, parental surveys were provided in several languages addressing families with various migration and language backgrounds (see above). Parents were asked questions on
the family background, children’s characteristics. The focus lay on various aspects of the HLE and the first part assessed the home literacy environment with items on linguistic activities
and literacy exposure of the study child at home (example items: “how many books do you have at home”, “how often is your child read to”). In the next part of the survey, parents were asked questions
about the home numeracy environment (example items: “How often do you play games with your child that require him or her to count?” etc.

c) Assessment and Test Instruments

Different studies have used different operationalizations to assess the HLE. Sometimes the HLE was measured directly in the family by surveillance of the learning environment a family provides (questionnaires were used in which the parents were asked to indicate their knowledge about children’s books). Several test instruments are used to assess various child competencies. During the project period, these assessments will be conducted at four different time points in the kindergarten and early school phase. The first assessments (t1) in summer 2020 included the test instruments below:

i. Mathematical competencies: Several mathematical and arithmetic (sub)tests for kindergarten children were used to assess children’s mathematical competencies. For instance, these tests addressed children’s counting, calculating, comparing of numbers and amounts, and number knowledge. Here, the screening “Mathematik- und Rechenkonzepte im Vorschulalter-Screening” (MARKO-S), different subtests from the “Würzburger Vorschultest”(WVT) and an adapted version of the calculation subtest of the “Test mathematischer Basiskompetenzen im Kindergartenalter” (MBK) were applied.

ii.  General cognitive abilities: In addition to the numeracy and literacy assessments, children’s general cognitive abilities were tested with several test instruments. The Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS) was used to assess children’s nonverbal intelligence. Further, children’s ability to concentration was assessed with the “Kaseler-Konzentrations-Aufgabe für 3- bis 8-Jährige” (KKA). Children’s working memory capacity was measured with a forward digit span task (a subscale of the WVT]).
Finally, a rapid picture naming task was used to test children’s fast access to long-term memory. 

d) Intervention approach

The intervention in Learning4Kids uses a tablet-based approach. For this intervention, already existing learning apps were identified, and new ones were designed and developed that are suited to promote efficient learning
of kindergarten children at home.
In addition to the learning apps, children also received e-books, audio books, and children’s music. Whereas the numeracy intervention group received five e-books and one audio book that focused on numbers, the control
group received two e-books for children on emotions and social interaction, one audio book on concentration, and three music CDs for children and in the second intervention phase, two e-books, three audio books and one music
CD. In comparison, the literacy group received altogether 23 e-books, 32 audio books, and 7 music CDs and videos for children as shared reading and listening to audio books is a specific and key part of family literacy interventions.
To balance the input between the three tablet groups, the literacy group received only 12 instead of 18 learning apps during the intervention.

# <a name="5 Discussion">Discussion:</a>

One important challenge for policy and research is to find ways to support the development of children who start life disadvantaged due to their family circumstances and the lower quality home learning environment they
experience. Family background variables such as SES or a migration background can hardly be changed, but the HLE, which is closely associated with these variables, can readily be tackled.

This project exploits new technological possibilities afforded by smart phones and tablet computers that are very common nowadays in families and that will appeal to many families, regardless of their backgrounds. Whilst
countless so-called ‘learning games’ and ‘learning apps for children are available online, few have been evaluated. The planned intervention will lead to empirically tested, inexpensive software for interested families
that will be accessible to the general public due to low download fees as well as scope to translate the apps into other languages.

In addition to the learning apps, our intervention also includes parental information and tips for everyday interaction with their children independent of any technical devices. Consequently, we follow a multifaceted approach with families and focus on directly stimulating and motivating the children as well as educate the parents. Altogether, we believe that our intervention approach will enrich and reinforce the quality of parent-child interactions and enrich the
caregiving environment.

# <a name="6 Conclusion">Conclusion:</a>

With this intervention, large numbers of families and children could be accessed and it might impact positively on several important areas:

(1) The education of all children whose learning may be supported by meaningful and well-developed learning apps,

(2) The integration of children who start life disadvantaged by their family circumstances, which influences later individual success and the opportunities to fully develop their potential and
contribute to societal prosperity,

(3) The support of parents who yet have to fully embrace the possibilities of smartphones and tablet computers in the context of education as they might shy away from learning apps that have not
been positively evaluated,

(4) Substantive advances for the scientific fields of psychology and education.

Therefore, we believe that this project has the potential to not only provide us with important scientific insight, but also to have a positive impact on child development, families, and the broader society
